## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS box-shadow

### What I learned

I learnt that it quickly becomes complex to handle all the spacing and font size values as css grows big

So in keep things consistent, we should predefine them in css variables in the theme

```css
:root {
  /* Spacing */
  --space-xxs: 0.5rem;
  --space-xs: 1rem;
  --space-sm: 1.5rem;
  --space-md: 2rem;
  --space-lg: 3rem;
  --space-xl: 4rem;
  --space-xxl: 5rem;

  /* Radius */
  --border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

I also learnt the importance of devtools when u get suck in identifying spaces, paddings and margins

### Continued development

I would like to continue development in handling the spacing and using them with css vars effectively
